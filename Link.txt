Seattle is a major city in North-western United States in the state of Washington. It is the city where I currently reside at.
It has various water bodies surrounding it and different features including various beaches, tall mountains which makes it an interesting site.
This region is also close to the region of British Columbia in Canada and thus, there is a possibility of data mixup due to proximity of the regions.
